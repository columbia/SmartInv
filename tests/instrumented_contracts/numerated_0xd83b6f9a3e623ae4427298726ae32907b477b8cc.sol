The \"original\" mystery?\n    The way I see it, there was no spark; time has no beginning.\n\n    We can try to find that early place, before everything; indeed, perhaps it's our duty.\n  But that quest to find the first little thing that happened is an asymptote to the unknowable.\n  As if something could flicker out of nothing, the first vibration in a void is just as likely\n  the last of what came before, dancing on a mirror's edge.\n\n    And yet, undaunted, we pull on those strings, yearning to unravel the mystery of our origin.\n  Which thus far, brings us to the elements eight. Whether you worship those gods, practice the\n  schools of magic, or pay no heed at all, the one shared truth is that these elements are the\n  fundamental building blocks of our world. Learned arcanists believe each its own substrate of\n  aether, a medium upon which pure elemental energy flows, and from the summation of those\n  microscopic movements arise the physical laws as we know them. It's that knowledge that's gotten\n  us this far.\n\n    Of course, most scoff at the theorycraft, finding it easier to cling to the zealotry of this\n  element's church or that. Nevertheless, all eyes are on this singular discovery: the reliquary.\n  Ancient and nameless, lost in the shifting sands of the Bal'gurub, its existence will bring\n  every explorer worth their salt for horizons around. If you can get inside, and claim one of\n  its relics, study it; there's no doubt we'll be one step closer to uncovering the truth.\n\n    Now, be warned, adventurer. We know not what dangers lie within, nor how to gain entry.\n  Steel yourself, take what supplies you can carry, and elements, or gods, be with you.\n\n    Ahn Pendrose\n    Guild's Knight of the Seekers\n */\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.4;\n\nimport \"@0xsequence/sstore2/contracts/SSTORE2.sol\";\nimport '@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/utils/ERC721Holder.sol';\nimport '@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol';\nimport '@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Strings.sol';\nimport './ERC721ATM.sol';\nimport './TRMeta.sol';\n\n/// @notice There are reports, first sourced from a nomadic shepherd, that indicate an enigmatic\n///         structure has been partially revealed by the sands' ebb and flow.
