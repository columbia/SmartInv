This GCAC token has the following properties:\r\n *\r\n * 1. The number of GCAC tokens from this contract that will be initially added to the \r\n *    Uniswap liquidity pool shall be 100,000. The amount of WETH added to the other side of\r\n *    the initial Uniswap liquidity pool shall be 5.\r\n * 2. GCAC hereby commits to swap an amount of WETH currency with the Uniswap GCAC<>WETH \r\n *    trading pair every 3 months for no fewer than 8 quarters, i.e., 2 years, commencing \r\n *    for the quarterly report as filed by GCAC for the quarter ending 31-March-2021.\r\n * 3. The value of the WETH currency swapped by GCAC shall be equal to 1% of GCAC's official\r\n *    'revenue', as disclosed in each of its quarterly regulatory filings. Each WETH\r\n *    swap shall be performed no later than 10 working days after the regulatory filing is\r\n *    available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (SEDAR). SEDAR \r\n *    is a mandatory document filing system for Canadian public companies.\r\n * 4. GCAC tokens returned by Uniswap from the quarterly swap of WETH shall be burned \r\n *    by this smart contract, thereby reducing GCAC token circulating supply over time.\r\n * 5. This contract shall not be allowed mint any new GCAC tokens, i.e., no dilution.\r\n * 6. GCAC, the company, shall initially hold 100,000 GCAC tokens on its corporate\r\n *    balance sheet, i.e., the GCAC treasury tokens.\r\n * 7. GCAC's treasury tokens may only ever be swapped for WETH in Uniswap and are prevented\r\n *    from being transferred out of this contract to another exchange or wallet, i.e., no rug-pull.\r\n * 8. GCAC hereby commits to notify the DeFi community of its intent to withdraw liquidity from \r\n *    Uniswap at least 3 months in advance. This contact enforces the liquidity-time-lock.\r\n * 9. GCAC hereby commits to notify the DeFi community of its intent to swap GCAC treasury tokens \r\n *    on Uniswap at least 3 months in advance. This contact enforces the treasury-time-lock.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * https://abbey.ch/         -- Abbey Technology GmbH, Zug, Switzerland\r\n * \r\n * ABBEY DEFI\r\n * ========== \r\n * 1. Decentralized Finance 'DeFi' is designed to be globally inclusive. \r\n * 2. Centralized finance is based around national stock markets that have high barriers to entry. \r\n * 3. The Abbey DeFi methodology offers companies listed on national stock exchanges exposure to DeFi.\r\n *\r\n * Abbey is a Uniswap-based DeFi service provider that allows public companies to offer people a novel \r\n * way to speculate on the success of their business in a decentralized manner.\r\n * \r\n * The premise is both elegant and simple, the public company commits to a marketing spend equal to 1% \r\n * of its quarterly sales revenue. And, since it’s a public company, the exact value of this 1% is \r\n * published in their public accounts, as filed quarterly with a national securities regulator.\r\n * \r\n * Using Abbey as a Uniswap DeFi marketing agency, the public company spends 1% of its quarterly cash \r\n * sales revenue on one side of a bespoke Uniswap trading contract. The other side of the Uniswap trade \r\n * is the public company’s proprietary token that’s representing 1% of its future sales revenue.\r\n * \r\n * DeFi traders wishing to speculate on the revenue growth of the public company deposit crypto-USD \r\n * in return for “PUBCO-1%” Uniswap tokens. The Uniswap Automated Market Maker ensures DeFi market \r\n * liquidity and legitimate price discovery. The more USD that the company deposits over time, the \r\n * higher the value of the PUBCO-1% token, as held by DeFi speculators.\r\n *\r\n*/\r\npragma solidity 0.7.6;\r\n\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @title Global Cannabis Applications Corporation (GCAC) contract for Uniswap.\r\n * @author Abbey Technology GmbH\r\n * @notice Token contract for use with Uniswap.
