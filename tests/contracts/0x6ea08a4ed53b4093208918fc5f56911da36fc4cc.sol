distinct from token totalSupply\n    - callerCap: a per-address limit; easily avoided, but useful for allowlist/prerelase minting\n    - transactionCap: a per-transaction limit, particularly useful for keeping ERC721A batches reasonable\n  - withdrawal functions for both Ether and ERC-20 tokens\n  - mint() calls our configured Void21 token, which provides privileges to this contract\n     a `setAdmin` function and an `onlyAdmin` modifier\n\n  Void Runners extensions to DropShop721:\n\n  - mint phase control, instead of startTime/endTime\n  - a merkle-tree-based allowlist, letting defined addresses mint early\n  - \"friend\" contract allowlist, allowing holders of specified contracts to mint early\n  - the two prerelease phases above are subject to an aggregate `prereleaseCap`,\n    which counts against the buyer's total `callerCap`\n  - staff minting, with an immutable `staffCap` maximum\n  - removed refunds for excess payments; please only pay exact amount\n  - individual requires() have been replaced with modifiers; which are cleaner\n    and more composable, but slightly less gas-efficient\n  - the custom Tiny721 token has been replaced with an ERC721A-based token, and\n    ERC721's storage optimizations are leveraged for supply and `prereleaseCap` tracking\n*/\ncontract DropShop721 is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {\n    using SafeERC20 for IERC20;\n\n    // --- STORAGE --- //\n\n    /// address of the ERC-721 item being sold.\n    address public immutable collection;\n\n    /// maximum number of items from the `collection` that may be sold.\n    uint256 public immutable totalCap;\n\n    /// The maximum number of items that a single address may purchase.\n    uint256 public immutable callerCap;\n\n    /// The maximum number of items that may be purchased in a single transaction.\n    uint256 public immutable transactionCap;\n\n    /// limit number of items that can be purchased per-person during the pre-release window (allowlist/friends)\n    uint256 public immutable prereleaseCap;\n\n    /// limit to number of items that can be claimed by the staff\n    uint256 public immutable staffCap;\n\n    /// price at which to sell the item\n    uint256 public immutable price;\n\n    /// destination of withdrawn payments\n    address public immutable paymentDestination;\n\n    /// current phase of the mint;
