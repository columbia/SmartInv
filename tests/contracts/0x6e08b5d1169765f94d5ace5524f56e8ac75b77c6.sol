The idea is simple: you buy a meme coin, and then you dump it on someone else for a profit. 🎲\n\n💥 But we don't want Radbros to get their ETH stack rekt by other bros. That's why we're introducing $BRO! 😎\n\n💪 $BRO enables fun, good-spirited competition to see who can bro out their $RAD stack. 🚀 Those without $RAD will need ETH to buy $RAD and join the $BRO PvP! 🥊\n\n🌟 The net effect of $BRO? Elevating the $RAD ecosystem by increasing demand for $RAD! 📈 Let's send it together, Radbros! 🌱\n\n⚠️ Trading restricted to Milady/Remilio/Radbro/SchizoPoster holders for the first 5 min of pool launch to prevent botting. 🤖 Stay alert! 🚨\n\nTokenomics: 📊\n\n- 1 Billion Total $BRO 💰\n- Trading Pair: $RAD/$BRO 🤝\n- No Tax 🚫\n- Liquidity Locked 🔒\n- RADBRO Anti-Botting Technology 🛡️\n- 20% Presale 🎁\n- 10% Team 🏆\n- 70% LP 🔄\n\nTips from the Radbro Devs: 📝\n\n- Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. 💸\n- HAVE FUN! 😃🎉\n\nWebsite: https://radbro.xyz\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/radbro_webring\nTelegram: https://t.me/bromafiabro\n*/\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nimport { ERC20 } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol\";\nimport { Ownable } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\nimport { IERC721 } from \"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/IERC721.sol\";\nimport { MerkleProofLib } from \"lib/solmate/src/utils/MerkleProofLib.sol\";\n\n/// @notice ERC20 token for the $BRO pvp coin\ncontract BroCoin is Ownable, ERC20 {\n    bool public publicTradingStarted;\n    IERC721[] public whitelistedCollections;\n    mapping(address => bool) public blacklists;\n\n    constructor() ERC20(\"BroCoin\", \"BRO\") {\n        _mint(msg.sender, 1000000000 * 10 ** 18); // 1,000,000,000 BRO\n        // whitelist collections\n        whitelistedCollections = [\n            IERC721(0x5Af0D9827E0c53E4799BB226655A1de152A425a5), // Milady\n            IERC721(0xD3D9ddd0CF0A5F0BFB8f7fcEAe075DF687eAEBaB), // Remilio\n            IERC721(0xABCDB5710B88f456fED1e99025379e2969F29610), // Radbro\n            IERC721(0xBfE47D6D4090940D1c7a0066B63d23875E3e2Ac5) // SchizoPoster\n        ];\n    }\n\n    function blacklist(address _address, bool _isBlacklisting) external onlyOwner {\n        blacklists[_address] = _isBlacklisting;\n    }\n\n    function setPublicTradingStarted(bool _publicTradingStarted) external onlyOwner {\n        publicTradingStarted = _publicTradingStarted;\n    }\n\n    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {\n        require(!blacklists[to] && !blacklists[from], \"Blacklisted\");\n        require(publicTradingStarted || _whitelistedForTrading(from, to), \"Trading is not started\");\n    }\n\n    function burn(uint256 value) external {\n        _burn(msg.sender, value);\n    }\n\n    function _whitelistedForTrading(address from, address to) internal view returns (bool) {\n        // always true for owner\n        if (from == owner() || to == owner()) {\n            return true;\n        }\n        // always true if balanceOf from or to is >1 for whitelisted collections\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < whitelistedCollections.length; i++) {\n            if (whitelistedCollections[i].balanceOf(from) > 0 || whitelistedCollections[i].balanceOf(to) > 0) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n"
