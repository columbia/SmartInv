 * *For a detailed writeup see our guide [How to implement supply

 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance`

 * allowances. See `IERC20.approve`.
