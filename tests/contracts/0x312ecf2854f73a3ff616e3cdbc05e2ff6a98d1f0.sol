When a snapshot is created, the balances and\n * total supply at the time are recorded for later access.\n *\n * This can be used to safely create mechanisms based on token balances such as trustless dividends or weighted voting.\n * In naive implementations it's possible to perform a \"double spend\" attack by reusing the same balance from different\n * accounts. By using snapshots to calculate dividends or voting power, those attacks no longer apply. It can also be\n * used to create an efficient ERC20 forking mechanism.\n *\n * Snapshots are created by the internal {_snapshot} function, which will emit the {Snapshot} event and return a\n * snapshot id.

To get the balance of an account at the time of a snapshot, call the {balanceOfAt} function with the snapshot id\n * and the account address.\n *\n * ==== Gas Costs\n *\n * Snapshots are efficient. Snapshot creation is _O(1)_. Retrieval of balances or total supply from a snapshot is _O(log\n * n)_ in the number of snapshots that have been created, although _n_ for a specific account will generally be much\n * smaller since identical balances in subsequent snapshots are stored as a single entry.\n *\n * There is a constant overhead for normal ERC20 transfers due to the additional snapshot bookkeeping.
