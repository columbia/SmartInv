It enables anyone to tokenize, monetize, analyze and scale\ntheir business with blockchain. Users who deploy smart contracts on\nBlockwell’s blockchain agree to do so on the terms and conditions of this\nBlockwell Smart License, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing with\nBlockwell.\n\nThe Blockwell Smart License is an evolved version of GNU General Public\nLicense version 2. The extent of the modification is to reflect Blockwell’s\nintention to require its users to send a minting and system transfer fee to\nthe Blockwell network each time a smart contract is deployed (or token is\ncreated). These fees will then be distributed among Blockwell token holders\nand to contributors that build and support the Blockwell ecosystem.\n\nYou can create a token on the Blockwell network at:\nhttps://app.blockwell.ai/prime\n\nThe accompanying source code can be used in accordance with the terms of this\nLicense, using the following arguments, with the bracketed arguments being\ncontractually mandated by this license:\n\ntokenName, tokenSymbol, tokenDecimals, tokenSupply, founderWallet,\n[0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC],\n[0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC], [20], attorneyWallet,\nattorneyAndLegalEmailAddress\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, deployment and\nmodification follow.\n\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, DEPLOYMENT AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\n   placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\n   of this License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work,\n   and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\n   derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\n   Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\n   translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included\n   without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed\n   as \"you\".\n\n   Activities other than copying, distribution, deployment and modification are\n   not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\n   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only\n   if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having\n   been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the\n   Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\n   you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\n   appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\n   disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\n   License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients\n   of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\n   at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,\n   thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such\n   modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\n   also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\n   you changed the files.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\n   part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n   licensed as a whole to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) You must cause Blockwell Fee Wallet\n   “0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC” to receive 2% of the total\n   supply of tokens each and every any time tokens are created on the\n   Blockchain network. This can be achieved using the current version of the\n   source code to which this License attaches by setting the “feeAccount”\n   parameter to Blockwell Fee Wallet\n   “0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC”, and the “feePercentageTenths”\n   parameter to “20” when deploying.\n\nd) You must add Blockwell’s wallet\n   “0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC” as a BW Admin, and you must\n   not restrict the abilities of a BW Admin in any derivative works. This can\n   be achieved using the current version of the source code to which this\n   License attaches by setting the “bwAdmin” parameter to Blockwell’s wallet\n   “0xda0f00d92086E50099742B6bfB0230c942DdA4cC” when deploying.\n\n   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\n   sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\n   considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\n   and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\n   separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\n   which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on\n   the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n   rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\n   right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\n   the Program.\n\n   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with\n   the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\n   distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\n   License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\n   Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1\n   and 2 above provided that you also make good faith and reasonable attempts\n   to make available the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\n   which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above.\n\n   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\n   modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\n   the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\n   definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and\n   installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source\n   code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in\n   either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and\n   so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that\n   component itself accompanies the executable.\n\n   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to\n   copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n   source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,\n   even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the\n   object code.\n\n   Distribution and execution of executable or object code as part of existing\n   smart contracts on the blockchain in the normal operation of the blockchain\n   network (miners, node hosts, infrastructure providers and so on) is excepted\n   from the requirement to make available the source code as set out in this\n   clause.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\n   expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\n   modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\n   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\n   who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\n   have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\n   compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\n   However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\n   Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\n   do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\n   Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of\n   this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\n   distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\n   the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor\n   to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and\n   conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'\n   exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for\n   enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so\n   as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any\n   other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute\n   the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\n   royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies\n   directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy\n   both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of\n   the Program.\n\n   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\n   the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\n   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\n   other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\n   section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\n   distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\n   people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\n   distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\n   distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\n   choice.\n\n   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\n   consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. Blockwell may publish revised and/or new versions of the Blockwell Smart\n   License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to\n   the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or\n   concerns.\n\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n9. THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE\n   LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\n   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\n   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\n   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM AND YOUR USE\n   OF THE SOURCE CODE INCLUDING AS TO ITS COMPLIANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE LAW\n   IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\n   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\n    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n    REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n    INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n    ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT\n    LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES\n    SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE\n    WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN\n    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n*/\n\npragma solidity >=0.8.0;\n\ncontract NoContract {\n\n}\n"
