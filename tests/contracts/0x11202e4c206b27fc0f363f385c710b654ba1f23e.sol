/**
Get 15% profit every month with a contract Shareholder VOMER!
*
* - OBTAINING 15% PER 1 MONTH. (percentages are charged in equal parts every 1 sec)
* 0.49995% per 1 day
* 0.020625% per 1 hour
* 0.0003375% per 1 minute
* 0.0000057% per 1 sec
* - lifetime payments
* - unprecedentedly reliable
* - bring luck
* - first minimum contribution from 0.01 eth
* - Currency and Payment - ETH
* - Contribution allocation schemes:
* - 100% of payments - 5% percent for support
* 
* VOMER.net
*
* RECOMMENDED GAS LIMIT: 200,000
* RECOMMENDED GAS PRICE: https://ethgasstation.info/
* DO NOT TRANSFER DIRECTLY FROM AN EXCHANGE (only use your ETH wallet, from which you have a private key)
* You can check payments on the website etherscan.io, in the “Internal Txns” tab of your wallet.
*
* Payments to developers 5%
*
* Restart of the contract is also absent. If there is no money in the Fund, payments are stopped and resumed after the Fund is filled. Thus, the contract will work forever!
*
* How to use:
* 1. Send from your ETH wallet to the address of the smart contract
* Any amount from 0.01 ETH.
* 2. Confirm your transaction in the history of your application or etherscan.io, indicating the address of your wallet.
* Take profit by sending 0 eth to contract (profit is calculated every second).
