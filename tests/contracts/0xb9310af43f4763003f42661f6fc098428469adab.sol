A slice represents a part of a string -\n *      anything from the entire string to a single character, or even no\n *      characters at all (a 0-length slice). Since a slice only has to specify\n *      an offset and a length, copying and manipulating slices is a lot less\n *      expensive than copying and manipulating the strings they reference.\n *\n *      To further reduce gas costs, most functions on slice that need to return\n *      a slice modify the original one instead of allocating a new one; for\n *      instance, `s.split(\".\")` will return the text up to the first '.',\n *      modifying s to only contain the remainder of the string after the '.'.\n *      In situations where you do not want to modify the original slice, you\n *      can make a copy first with `.copy()`, for example:\n *      `s.copy().split(\".\")`. Try and avoid using this idiom in loops; since\n *      Solidity has no memory management, it will result in allocating many\n *      short-lived slices that are later discarded.\n *\n *      Functions that return two slices come in two versions: a non-allocating\n *      version that takes the second slice as an argument, modifying it in\n *      place, and an allocating version that allocates and returns the second\n *      slice; see `nextRune` for example.\n *\n *      Functions that have to copy string data will return strings rather than\n *      slices; these can be cast back to slices for further processing if\n *      required.\n *\n *      For convenience, some functions are provided with non-modifying\n *      variants that create a new slice and return both; for instance,\n *      `s.splitNew('.')` leaves s unmodified, and returns two values\n *      corresponding to the left and right parts of the string.\n */\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\nlibrary strings {\n    struct slice {\n        uint _len;\n        uint _ptr;\n    }\n    \n    function memcpy(uint dest, uint src, uint len) private pure {\n        // Copy word-length chunks while possible\n        for(; len >= 32; len -= 32) {\n            assembly {\n                mstore(dest, mload(src))\n            }\n            dest += 32;\n            src += 32;\n        }\n\n        // Copy remaining bytes\n        uint mask = 256 ** (32 - len) - 1;\n        assembly {\n            let srcpart := and(mload(src), not(mask))\n            let destpart := and(mload(dest), mask)\n            mstore(dest, or(destpart, srcpart))\n        }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Returns a slice containing the entire string.\n     * @param self The string to make a slice from.\n     * @return A newly allocated slice containing the entire string.\n     */\n    function toSlice(string memory self) internal pure returns (slice memory) {\n        uint ptr;\n        assembly {\n            ptr := add(self, 0x20)\n        }\n        return slice(bytes(self).length, ptr);\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Copies a slice to a new string.\n     * @param self The slice to copy.\n     * @return A newly allocated string containing the slice's text.\n     */\n    function toString(slice memory self) internal pure returns (string memory) {\n        string memory ret = new string(self._len);\n        uint retptr;\n        assembly { retptr := add(ret, 32) }\n\n        memcpy(retptr, self._ptr, self._len);\n        return ret;\n    }\n\n    // Returns the memory address of the first byte of the first occurrence of\n    // `needle` in `self`, or the first byte after `self` if not found.\n    function findPtr(uint selflen, uint selfptr, uint needlelen, uint needleptr) private pure returns (uint) {\n        uint ptr = selfptr;\n        uint idx;\n\n        if (needlelen <= selflen) {\n            if (needlelen <= 32) {\n                bytes32 mask = bytes32(~(2 ** (8 * (32 - needlelen)) - 1));\n\n                bytes32 needledata;\n                assembly { needledata := and(mload(needleptr), mask) }\n\n                uint end = selfptr + selflen - needlelen;\n                bytes32 ptrdata;\n                assembly { ptrdata := and(mload(ptr), mask) }\n\n                while (ptrdata != needledata) {\n                    if (ptr >= end)\n                        return selfptr + selflen;\n                    ptr++;\n                    assembly { ptrdata := and(mload(ptr), mask) }\n                }\n                return ptr;\n            } else {\n                // For long needles, use hashing\n                bytes32 hash;\n                assembly { hash := keccak256(needleptr, needlelen) }\n\n                for (idx = 0; idx <= selflen - needlelen; idx++) {\n                    bytes32 testHash;\n                    assembly { testHash := keccak256(ptr, needlelen) }\n                    if (hash == testHash)\n                        return ptr;\n                    ptr += 1;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return selfptr + selflen;\n    }\n\n    /*\n     * @dev Splits the slice, setting `self` to everything after the first\n     *      occurrence of `needle`, and `token` to everything before it.
